# 🎬 IMDB Sentiment Analysis App

This project is a web-based deep learning application that classifies movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** using the IMDB dataset and a custom-trained TensorFlow model.

## 🚀 Demo
Try the app live on Hugging Face Spaces:  
🔗 [Click to Run the Sentiment Analyzer](https://seonaann-imdb-sentiment-analyzer.hf.space/?__theme=system&deep_link=6MiqJ6mEA24)

## 🧠 What I Built

- Trained a binary classification model using Keras
- Used tokenization, padding, and embeddings
- Converted the model into a Gradio web app (`app.py`)
- Deployed it publicly on Hugging Face for easy access
